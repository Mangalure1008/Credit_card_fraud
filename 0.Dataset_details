Source for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It contains 28 anonymized principal components (V1 to V28) as features, plus the 'Time' (seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset), 'Amount' (transaction value), and 'Class' (0 for legitimate transactions, 1 for fraudulent transactions).
Advantages: Relatively easy to understand, well-structured, allows for experimentation, and has a clear target variable ("Class").

# Load the dataset

    print("Error: 'creditcard.csv' not found.  Please check the file path.")

Explanation:
We import the necessary libraries (pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, scikit-learn for machine learning).
pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv') loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Important: Make sure the CSV file is in the same directory as your Python script or provide the correct file path.
df.head() displays the first 5 rows to inspect the data.
df.info() provides information about the dataset: data types, non-null values, etc. This helps understand the structure and identify potential issues.
